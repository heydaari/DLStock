## Introduction

Stock market prediction is a crucial task for investors and financial analysts. This project aims to predict future stock prices using historical data and a Bidirectional LSTM model, which can capture patterns in the data more effectively by considering both past and future contexts.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have the following libraries installed:

- Python 3.7+
- pandas
- numpy
- tensorflow
- sklearn
- matplotlib

You can install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy tensorflow sklearn matplotlib
